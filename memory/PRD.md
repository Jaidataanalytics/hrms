Comprehensive HR management system for Sharda Diesels with employee management, attendance tracking, payroll, leave management, and insurance modules.

## Core Modules

### 1. Employee Management
- Employee directory with search and filters
- Bulk import/export functionality
- **Role-Based Access:** Only HR/Admin can access Employees page (employees cannot see this menu)
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Rejects duplicate emp_code and email during import

### 2. Attendance Management (Enhanced - Jan 2026)
- Organization-wide attendance view (HR/Admin only)
- Individual attendance tracking
- **Role-Based Access:** 
  - HR/Admin: See Organization toggle and can view all employees
  - Employees: Only see "My Attendance" view (no Organization toggle)
- **Date Range Filters:**
  - Presets: Current Month, Last Month, Last 3 Months, Year to Date
  - Custom date range with from/to date pickers
- **Summary & Analytics Tab:**
  - Total Present Days, Absent Days, Late Instances, WFH Days
  - Perfect Attendance count
  - Rankings: Most Late (Top 10), Most Absent (Top 10)
  - Perfect Attendance list
  - Most Hours Worked (Top 10)
  - All Employee Statistics table
- **Late Marking:** Arrival after 09:45 is marked as LATE
- **Biometric API Integration:** Auto-sync every 3 hours from external biometric device
- **Time-based IN/OUT:** Before 12:00 = IN punch, After 12:00 = OUT punch

### 3. Leave Management
- Leave balance management
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Uses upsert during import

### 4. Payroll Management (Enhanced)
**Salary Structure:**
- Fixed Components: BASIC, DA, HRA, Conveyance, GRADE PAY, OTHER ALLOWANCE, Medical/Special Allowance
- Deduction Config: EPF, ESI, SEWA (toggles)
- Fixed Deductions: SEWA Advance, Other Deduction

**Employee Salary Edit:**

### 5. Insurance Module
- Employee Insurance Tab (ESIC, PMJJBY, Accidental)
- Business Insurance Tab

### 6. Global Search & Employee 360 View
- Global search bar (Cmd+K) - HR/Admin only
- Comprehensive employee profile page

### 7. Biometric API Integration (Jan 2026)
**Features:**
- **Automatic sync on startup** - Checks if data exists, runs historical sync if not
- Scheduled sync every 3 hours via APScheduler
- Manual sync trigger for HR/Admin
- Historical sync (up to 1 year) for super_admin
- Sync status dashboard and logs
- Smart IN/OUT detection based on time

**How it works:**
1. On app startup, checks if biometric attendance data exists
2. If NO data → automatically runs 1-year historical sync
3. If data exists → runs regular 2-day sync
4. Scheduler runs every 3 hours for ongoing updates

**This fixes the production sync issue** - deployed version will now auto-sync on first startup.

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/biometric/sync` - Manual sync (admin only)
- `POST /api/biometric/sync/historical` - Historical sync (super_admin only)
- `POST /api/biometric/sync/refresh-all` - Clear and re-sync all attendance
- `POST /api/biometric/sync/recalculate-late` - Recalculate late status for all records
- `GET /api/biometric/sync/status` - Get sync logs and stats
- `GET /api/biometric/sync/unmatched-codes` - List unmatched employee codes
- `GET /api/attendance/summary` - Get attendance summary and analytics for date range

## Authentication & Security

### First Login Password Change
- All new employees imported with `must_change_password: true`
- On first login, user must change password before accessing dashboard
